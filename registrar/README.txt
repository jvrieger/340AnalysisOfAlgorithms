To compile brynmawr scheduling: 
javac Main.java

To run brynmawr scheduling:
sh /registrar/constraintsExamples/constraintsBMC.txt /registrar/constraintsExamples/studentsBMC.txt /registrar/constraintsExamples/schedule.txt

Of Note:
We have edited the input files generated by get_bmc_info/py > Fall2000.csv
removing the specifics on Class Times (times, days).
We were able to process every other constraint present in the resulting data files.
Note--In the files provided (constraintsBMC.txt and studentsBMC.txt) the id values are numbered differently
and have less than what is outputed from Fall2000.csv. This is not of consequence, but was for ease of troubleshooting.

Also of Note:
What was submitted on November 16 is the program files for the randomly generated data, we were unable to submit them today.
What is submitted on November 21 is the program files for the bryn mawr scheduling data.
